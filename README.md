# Leg-Bouncing-And-Everyday-Activity-Dataset

This dataset includes tri-axial data collected from six leg bouncers during sitting, standing, walking, running, cycling, tapping legs for music, and bouncing their legs.

The file structure of this repository demonstrates three main categories of movements:

	•	Low-movements 
		- still sitting,
		- still standing, 
	 	- free sitting,
		- free standing with and without interactions, 
		- sitting down,
		- standing up

	•	High-movements
		- walking, 
		- running, 
		- cycling, 
		- stepping up and down staircases,
		- feet tapping to music
		
	•	Leg bouncings 
		- lower leg swinging (fast repetitive movement of the heel of one leg that is on the knee of the other leg), 
		- upper leg swinging (fast repetitive movement of both thighs in left and right directions, while feet are on the ground) 
		- jiggling (fast repetitive swings of the lower leg in which thigh is crossed over the other thigh), 
		- fast repetitive toe tapping
		- fast repetitive heel tapping. 

Each file is an instance of one movement type contributed by one leg of a participant and takes the name convention:

<R/L - indicating which leg>\_\<movement tag>\_\<participant number>
